# Expresser

Simple mathematics library for C#, optimized for performance in data-driven games.

## Project State

This project came about as a result of a personal project of mine requiring a way of expression conditions in data. As a result, there are still many things that this project lacks. If your looking for a more complete implementation I highly recommend [ExpressionEvaluator](https://github.com/codingseb/ExpressionEvaluator).

## Todo

- Introduce another intermediary form of an expression to increase evaluation performance.
- Support for `%` operator in use in defining percentages
- Support for `!` as a NOT operator
- Support for bitwise operators
- Case insensitive `true` and `false`
- Introduce "Functions" (`max(5, 10)`, `mod(11.5)`)
