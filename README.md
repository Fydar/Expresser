## Usage

```csharp
using System;
using Expresser;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var context = new MathContextBuilder()
            .WithTerm("Width", new StaticValueProvider(10))
            .Build();

        var expression = new CompiledExpression("0.1*Width", context);

        var result = expression.Evaluate();

        Console.WriteLine (expression);        // 0.1 * Width
        Console.WriteLine (result.ValueClass); // ValueClassifier.Float
        Console.WriteLine (result.FloatValue); // 1
    }
}
```

This project follows commit guidelines specified by [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me), with the exception of using the raw unicode character (‚ú®) rather than a string (`:sparkles:`). This is to increase compatibility with Git clients.

Commit messages should target around a 50 character long headline, with any addition information following two line breaks. [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) uses this format when you are writing your commit messages.

Feel free to submit pull requests, referencing any relevant issues and listing a brief overview of the changes in the pull request.

### Code Style

An `.editorconfig` is included in the project that will ensure that your IDE follows the projects code style. I recommend you use an IDE that supports `.editorconfig` files such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
